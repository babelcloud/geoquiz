# 📱 Gbox APK Testing Guide

## 🔒 Critical Rules

- **Always** open the Android box's **Live View URL** (`open_live_view`) in your default browser **immediately after** creating or starting a Gbox Android box.
- Use the **absolute file path** to your APK (e.g., `/Users/jack/workspace/geoquiz/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`) when calling the `install_apk` tool.
- **Wait for the APK to finish installing** before interacting with the app.  
  You can pass the parameter `open=true` to automatically launch the app after installation.
- If multiple boxes are running, ensure you're **only operating on the correct box** for your current test session.

## 🛠️ Using the `ui_action` Tool for UI Testing

Use the `ui_action` tool to control the Android UI with natural language commands.  
Here are some example commands you can use:

- Tap the email input field  
- Tap the submit button  
- Tap the plus button in the upper right corner  
- Fill the search field with text: `gbox ai`  
- Press the back button  
- Double-click the video

## ✅ Example: Proper Testing Flow

1. **Create** a new Android box and obtain its `boxId`.
2. **Open** the Live View for that `boxId` in your browser.
3. **Install** the APK using its **absolute path**, e.g.:  /abs/path/to/repo/geoquiz/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk, Add the parameter `open=true` if you'd like the app to launch automatically.
4. **Use `ui_action`** to simulate user interactions based on your test case.
5. After each action, **review the Live View screenshot** to confirm the result.
6. Continue the **action-review loop** until your test scenario is complete.

## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- 🚫 Not opening the **Live View URL** right after creating the box.
- 🚫 Using a **relative path** (e.g., `./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`) for `install_apk`.
- 🚫 Sending **multiple UI actions in one command** or using **unclear/vague language** with `ui_action`.
